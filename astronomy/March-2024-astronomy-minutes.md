# March 2024 Meeting of the Astronomy Curriculum Advisors  

The meeting took place on **March 19, 2024, 20.00-21.00 CET**.


## Attendants

* Azalee Bostroem  
* Heather Andrews  
* Ivelina Momcheva  
* Meredith Rawls  


## Roles

**Facilitator:** Azalee  

**Notetaker:** Heather  

**Timekeeper:** Azalee  


## Agenda

### Update schedule on workshop website

- Would it be an idea to update the schedule of a workshop to something more descriptive than 'morning' and 'afternoon'?  
    * (Azalee) We can base it on time estimates for each episode e.g. https://abostroem.github.io/2024-01-06-aas/ - **everyone agreed**  


### AAS workshop

- Last time (we know) the workshop was carried out was [January 2024](https://abostroem.github.io/2024-01-06-aas/)    
    * It went well and got very positive feedback.  
    * Encountered some challenges with Anaconda (e.g., using too much memory). The work around was that instead of using the environment, participants installed one package at a time.  
    * Azalee found some issues in the online curriculum and did some pull requests.  


### Future of CAC

- No money to sustain the staff.  
- Question to the everyone: is it necessary to meet every quarter?    
    * Meredith, Heather and Ivelina agree that meeting every quarter may not be necessary.     
    * (Azalee) perhaps meet every 6 months - **everyone agreed**  
- Should we look for funding opportunities to run the workshop e.g. for institutions/people not involved in AAS?     
    * IAU (e.g., pan-african school for astrophysics).    
    * Astropy also offers grants.    
    * Mozilla has supported the Carpentries.    
    * NASA also offers Open Science initiative funds.  
    * [Open Science Netherlands (OSNL)](https://www.openscience.nl/en/news/grants-available-for-open-science-meetings) offers funding to organize Open Science related-events.  


### Pull requests not being merged  

- Azalee asked Toby and Erin about this.    
- There will be an open call for Maintainers on March 26th, 2024.  


### Extras

- Next meeting around next equinox.  
- Reminder to everyone: **please check The Carpentries Slack** on a regular basis (e.g., for the discussion on looking for funding opportunities to run the workshop).
